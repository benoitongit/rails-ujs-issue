Expected behavior

1/ Click on Edit link -> redirected to edit page
2/ Click on Submit form -> redirected to show page
3/ Click on edit link -> redirected to edit page

Actual behavior

1/ Click on Edit link -> redirected to edit page
2/ Click on Submit form -> redirected to show page
3/ Click on edit link -> request is cancelled, staying on show page :/

If I replace rails-ujs with jquery-rails gem it then works correctly.
